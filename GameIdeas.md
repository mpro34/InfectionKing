animals making them more deadly. You are a lone human who has lost his memory and trying to survive. You start with very basic weapons. As you kill creatures and forage for items, you are
able to create new weapons and/or tools to help you progress the game.

ability to fight off infected beasts and make it a safe-haven. The king of Infection, dubbed the InfectionKing, however is very evil and performs
