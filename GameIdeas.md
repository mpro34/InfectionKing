### Story
The world is a pre-jurassic era where everything is large and out to kill you. During this time-period an infection runs rampant that has mutated various
animals making them more deadly. You are a lone human who has lost his memory and trying to survive. You start with very basic weapons. As you kill creatures and forage for items, you are
able to create new weapons and/or tools to help you progress the game.

There are a very small number of human settlements around the world. The most well known settlement is called Infection, named after their collective
ability to fight off infected beasts and make it a safe-haven. The king of Infection, dubbed the InfectionKing, however is very evil and performs
regular experiments on humans within Infection and infected beasts.

As you progress in the story, you get flashes of memory back and realize that your ultimate goal is to reclaim you title as the InfectionKing and restore
peace to Infection.

# Idea 2 - More Solid!
### Story
The year is 3000 AD; a deadly virus has ravaged life on earth. After decades, three groups of humans were established; the infected, the normals, and the specials. You are a special trying to restore some semblance of peace on earth as part of the World Government. The specials are infected humans who have undergone mutations from the infection, but have kept their knowledge and have gained additional abilities. The leader of the specials, who orchestrates the specials kingdom, is known as the Infection King.

Your mission is to find and eliminate the Infection King.

### Type of Game
2D Platformer

### How to Play
A 2D platformer where you can level up skills and gain new equipment. Think Metroid and Castlevania.

You complete missions that lead to other unexplored regions and eventually find the Infection King's kingdom. Take him down and you win the game.
