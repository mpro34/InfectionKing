  Humans have never been created; during the start of the Cretaceous Period 150 Million Years Ago (After the Jurrassic Period), a new form of being came into existence, the ____. These creatures started as a infectious bacteria that would feed off of the decomposing lifeforms throughout the world. They can survive in extreme temperatures and pressures, and would evolve the decomposing body into a new species. Fast forward 500 years, the ____ have become the dominiant species on earth, because of their innnate abnilityu to replicate from the dead bodies all around. However, a rare species of ____ emerged that was able to have coherent thoughts, not just instinct, and could control those ____ that were lesser. This Overminds comprised of 0.001% of the ___ population. 
  They rose incredibly quickly to the top of the food chain, using the lesser ___ to hunt and gather for them. Over the centuries there has been several power struggles between the Overminds, each having very unique abilities. Although they have lived in relative peace for years, they still only possess primative technology, since they rely on the lesser to do their bidding. They are put to the test, when an advanced civilization comes from space to conquer their lands. They must figure out how to negotiate, fightback, or they face extinction.
  
  You play as various Overminds, in control of a pack of wights. The wights are the lesser ____ that only use instincts to survive. You are able to control the wights and use your inherent bacteria to infect dead animals to obtain more wights. Since Overminds have strong mental capacities, their physical capacities lack. Therefore, they must attack and defend with their pack of weights by shooting enemies with their attack or action pheromone. That is, there will be several kinds of pheremones each commanding the wights to perform a specific action. The Overminds and only run and dodge from a distance.
  
  Later on, the Overmind gets physical abilties from consuming a wight. This includes the abilities to attack and defend without wights, etc.
